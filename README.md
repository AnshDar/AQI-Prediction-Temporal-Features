# Air Quality Time Series Prediction

This project predicts PM2.5 levels using machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) with GPU support in Google Colab.

## How to Run
1. Open `air_quality_prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Make sure all CSVs are in the `data/` folder.
3. Run all cells sequentially.
4. Models will train, and evaluation metrics and feature importance plots will display.

## Requirements
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, xgboost
- Google Colab (GPU recommended)
